This project is a collection (will be updated) of helpers for flex applications.
the project can be used as a library or as source inside your project.

the first helper is a Pluralization Helper which is a porting of the ROR implementation.
the original code was written by http://flexonrails.com, I changed it, and exposed a single function outside.
